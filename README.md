# CmbProjects
*This has been deprecated and has since been replaced with my new website, which can be found [here](https://github.com/29cmb/PersonalWebsite)*

A simple static html site to display the projects I've done. Using raw html and css.

A link to the website can be found [here](https://29cmb.github.io/CmbProjects/), hosted on github pages!
